## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Additional Libraries 

 - [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) a easy to use UI Library that supports Tailwind CSS and Typescript out of the box.

 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) a reliable open source [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) alternative.


## Additional Information

- Since `Web Design` and `Overall Development` for a project of this scale would take a while, I decided to use those libraries. They both are a reliable, easy to use and implement into your codebase without breaking anything in this repo. For more information read the additional libraries and the documentation of the given Libraries.

- The lead developer and the project manager will check this repo regularly in order to verify any merge cases and errors that might arise during the developmental cycle.
