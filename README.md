## Additional Information

- Since `Web Design` and `Overall Development` for a project of this scale would take a while, I decided to use those libraries. They both are a reliable, easy to use and implement into your codebase without breaking anything in this repo. For more information read the additional libraries and the documentation of the given Libraries.

- The lead developer and the project manager will check this repo regularly in order to verify any merge cases and errors that might arise during the developmental cycle.
