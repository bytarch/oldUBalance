## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Additional Libraries 

 - [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) a easy to use UI Library that supports Tailwind CSS and Typescript out of the box.

 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) a reliable open source [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) alternative.


## Additional Information

- Since `Web Design` and `Overall Development` for a project of this scale would take a while, I decided to use those libraries. They both are a reliable, easy to use and implement into your codebase without breaking anything in this repo. For more information read the additional libraries and the documentation of the given Libraries.

- The lead developer and the project manager will check this repo regularly in order to verify any merge cases and errors that might arise during the developmental cycle.
